# Variable-Names

The random string scripts uses python to print out 5 different strings everytime it is run. I use this as a quick way when I need to create rando variable names for reverse shell, mostly for windows. This script is completly customizeable in what it should print out but by default it will print out 5 string that is between 12 and 18 characters long and contains capital letters, lowercase letters and numbers.

Setup & Usage
-------------

The Setuup and Usage is quite simple. You can either make the script executable or run it with python3.

1. Copy script to your machine.

2. Make it executalble with chmod +x script name, or execute it with python3 scriptname.
